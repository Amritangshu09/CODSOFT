-: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game :-

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and the PIL library for handling images.

Game Description:
In the game, the player competes against the computer. Each participant selects one of three choices: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
How to Play

Click on one of the buttons labeled "ROCK", "PAPER", or "SCISSOR" to select your choice.
